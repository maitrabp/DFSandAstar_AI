# DFSandAstar_AI
Duo-TeamProject:- AI - In this project we implemented two algorithms for optimal path on a maze which has blockades, A-star and Depth First Search respectively. For further project specifications, read P1.pdf
# Testing
 * For successful testing, you must have [Java] & [Java Development Kit] installed.
 * Run the app whether it is using Eclipse, Netbeans, or Visual Studio code or some other IDE.
 * The optimal result will show up on console for both algorithms. 
 * The result is generated based on the pre-coded grid. However, the algorithms run accurately on all types of grids.
